# Introduction and Business Question
New York City is the epitome of a modern metropolis that doesn’t have enough transit capacity. Everyone using a car would cause too much traffic to be on the road. The subway already carries a massive load. As commuters and politicians alike seek alternate options, biking is a fast-rising potential solution to help alleviate the strain on NYC roads and subways with the added benefit of being the greenest option of the three. However, unlike car or public transit travel like the subway, biking is subject to numerous external factors influencing it’s viability. Regardless of whether or not you live in NYC, you should care because what’s happening with transportation capabilities in NYC is a trend across American cities and the green factor of biking is true regardless of location. This leads us to the following business question: how can we better understand biking behavior in cities?

# Data Question
How can we predict biking behavior and understand common biking behavior patterns?

# Further Research
-More seasons
-More cities
-Incorporating non-bridge bike routes
-How does car traffic on bridges vary based on number of bikers?
-Driving factors (delivery, commute, recreation)
